                  <h2>hi, i&apos;m sarah<br />& i&apos;m so glad to meet you ðŸ™‚</h2>
                  <p>I&apos;ve been passionate about professional software development 16 years. Previous to then, I came to love it as a hobby, enjoying the process of developing and designing websites for whatever video game, music, or interest that I was into at the time.</p>
                  <p>Professionally, I&apos;ve grown from being in a junior role to senior and eventually to lead developer until I took my current senior role in order to spend time sharpening my skills as an individual contributor once more. I&apos;ve had the pleasure of building and leading a talented team of both full-time and internationally-based developers.</p>
                  <p>I truly enjoy the intersection of technology and collaboration. As a manager, I thrive on nurturing my team, discovering each person&apos;s strengths, and fostering a trusting environment where everyone can take ownership and grow into leaders.</p>
                  <p>As an developer, I&apos;m passionate about automation, scalability, and creating work that is both comprehensive and easy to understand.</p>
                  <p>If my background and approach resonate with you, I&apos;d love to chat. I look forward to connecting with you.</p>
